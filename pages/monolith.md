### Synopsis

Americans want to know what's going on. They need to know what's going on. They don't want to spend a whole lot of time finding out. And the latest polls show most of the nation no longer trusts the news media. And there are too many people, groups, and corporations who are invested in keeping the current state of the American media exactly where it is. The most efficient and effective solution is a fast flanking move which replaces the primary function of the news media with a new online information-delivery system run in a transparent and non-partisan manner.  At worst it provides the "fact checking" source material that is needed, at best it forces the media to re-invent itself back to goals intended in the Constitution.

### Overview

The idea comes from the way I get my news. I don’t watch TV news. I follow a small number of Twitter feeds that have proven reliable in delivering facts. For instance, one is a feed that just tracks where gunfire or violence happens around the world. When an alert goes up I quickly find follow-ups from local sources. By the time the “News Media” has the story, a lot of times the news they end up reporting is already quite stale.

Most people in the US are connected to the Internet. Even if just on their smart-phones, almost everyone can get online. What I propose is an entirely new online media platform run in a new way. The highlights are as follows:

- The service would be entirely devoted to delivering news and only news. Not opinions. Not politics. Not people sitting around on sofas making snide remarks. Actual news of what is happening. The focus would be on accuracy and speed of delivery - get the factual news out to people better and faster than the “real” media can do it.
* There would be no “anchor” desk. Video segments would be shot either on-location and streamed live, or would be shot at the various satellite offices. The state of technology today removes the need for expensive broadcast studios for doing the news in this manner.
* Not being burdened with needing to fill 24-hours of air time, or with preparing for a pre-set broadcast schedule, reduces the overhead greatly.
* A central editors desk would decide on which stories get posted when. “Central” means organizationally central - with online conferencing this whole network of news offices can be sited anywhere across the country.

### Content

* There would be three kinds of content. Stories, Streams, and Analysis.
* A “Story” is just like in a newspaper. Something happened, here are the facts. It can have video, Twitter posts, written copy, images, audio - very mixed-media - whatever it takes to tell it.
* A “Stream” is something happening now. It would be a combination of staff reporting and gathering information from The Internet and reposting it in the feed of posts and pictures, with video reports inter-spliced. The difference would be that this new agency could call local sources with the authority of a real news service and talk to local law enforcement and get the facts. These would then get posted. The response time would be faster than anything the “News Media” could muster. Once the event is over, the Stream's content becomes a Story. (Think of a Story as a Stream that's stopped flowing - they're both a sequence of mixed-media content blocks.)
* An “Analysis” is a long-standing issue or story which needs explanation. Where facts alone aren’t enough and you need expert opinions or more in-depth reporting. An example would be “unemployment.” Most people don’t know that there are multiple ways unemployment is measured and that it’s possible by choosing which figures to report for unemployment to “go down” while joblessness “went up”. Such content would engage experts on the issue from both sides to present their position. This would be like the rest: mixed media. If there was an online debate, there would be no screaming contests, just sane logical discourse. The goal is to provide facts from all perspectives and then let the people decide what it means to them.
* In order to mitigate bias, there would always be at least two staffers working on any piece of content. For a Stream, an ad-hoc team will be assembled for the time the Stream is running based on staff having experience or knowledge relevant to the incident being covered. Again, with teleconferencing and groupware, this allows knowledgeable assets to be brought to bear from all over the country or all over the planet.
* Subject matter would be: General News, Government (as opposed to “Politics” - would include: Policy, White House, Congress, Military, Committees, The Law, etc.), Business (& Economy), America (also broken into regions), World (also broken down into regions/continents), Health, Technology, and Science. No sports. No “entertainment” or fashion. Just the news that actually affects people’s day-to-day lives. Obviously news items could be associated with more than one category.

### Technology & Delivery

* The actual delivery mechanism would be online and mobile Apps. No need for broadcast towers or studios. Put the money into online content delivery and hiring good field reporters, writers, and online personalities. The App would allow users to tailor the alerts and filters based on interest, region, city, tags, and level of urgency (i.e. maybe you only want to be notified if something big happens).
* This would **not** be a social-media site, however. If folks want social media around it, they can spin up their own sites (hey … that creates more jobs!). This service would be only about news delivery. Making the American public the best informed it can be.
* There would be an API built into the system to allow new SaaS providers to hook in. For instance, if someone wanted to provide polls for Stories, there would be a way for them to do that without affecting or threatening the core system - the poll would appear on the page, but wouldn’t be allowed “inside” the news system.
* The one exception to the above rule is the service would also host Ask-Me-Anything segments from time to time with folks either from the Administration or from other walks of life whenever something was going on that warranted it. Again, these would be live and unedited - which means they’re also more honest and open.
* The cry that will no doubt erupt of “that’s state-run media” will be silenced by transparency. Any video segment that gets edited for time will have the original source material also posted. Any documents will likewise have the originals attached to the story record within the system. Any source of research material will likewise be included. Nothing will be hidden. As we’ve seen from the last six months, facts are winning now and will continue to do so.

### Reporting

* Live-Streaming reporters would be a big part of this. Good live-streaming reporters get better coverage and more “human” coverage than anything the likes of CNN can touch. It would need field reporters free of bias - driven to get the real story of what’s happening, not to feed their own personal narrative. What we used to call: journalists. Viewers are savvy enough now to sniff out biased reporting, so hitting that sweet spot with the field reporters is crucial.
* Good reporting will require going to protests and getting interviews with both sides, as well as the locals caught in the middle. For instance, Ferguson looked totally different when viewed from the Live-Streaming reporters than when viewed on the big-time TV Networks. Humanizing both sides of these debates is necessary to repair the damage of the last election.
* The field reporters will need to be honest, but respectful. This new service will re-set the bar in terms of ethics for the news media. So reporters will need to be persistent in trying to find the truth, but not to the point where they are badgering people. In the end this is better, as people will want to talk to this service's reporters since they know they'll be treated fair, and shown proper decorum.
* The Administration will need to make itself available to this new network’s reporters for unstructured interviews as well. The utter lack of transparency these last eight years needs to be undone. Also I think people will be very impressed with folks like Mattis if they hear them speak and answer questions.
* The reporters - field and desk-bound - will need to be more specialized and less generalists than what you have in a typical newsroom. Each should have areas of specific expertise - legal, technology, military, sociology, etc. This helps not only give the news more authority, but an expert eye will spot Fake News before it gets published. This new service can't be a bunch of "talking heads" - everyone needs to be knowledgeable.

### Logistics

* This venture would be given bipartisan and permanent funding. That is: they can’t be shut down for reporting inconvenient truths.  This also makes it more trustworthy as it’s essentially being funded by the people and not one party or the other, or some corporate interest.
* The actual content delivery platform (the part that excites me as a technologist) wouldn’t be that expensive to build. It’d need a new kind of publishing workflow to accommodate the speed of action needed, but otherwise it’s pretty standard Content Management principles. Servers would be positioned regionally for better response and to distribute load across the population centers better.
* This would require a core technology team of maybe a dozen people to build the system.
- Groupware, telecommuting, and agile development would be brought to bear to allow the broadcast and field offices to be located cost-effectively and also be re-located as needed. For instance, something like the Dakota Access Pipeline would warrant spinning up a field office near the action using just laptops and hand-held cameras and a rented storefront. When the news moves on, the office would be torn town and everyone goes back home.
* The system would utilize various SaaS providers (US-based, of course) to provide some core functionality (and thereby reduce development time and cost). This would be an obvious boost for these providers, creating more tech jobs, and reinforcing the Trump administration’s commitment to the Technology Sector.

### User Experience

Imagine a multi-column Twitter feed. Each column is the feed for some set of keywords or topics. Or a column can be a "Stream" of something happening now. Columns can also be broken up into rows. So you could have a "2x3" arrangement with two rows, each with three columns of feeds. Each tile in each feed column can be clicked on to open up a pop-up window with more information (the "story" or if it's a Stream, one of the pieces of information that's been posted). Any story can be "saved" either in the user's "scrapbook" (things they want to hang on to) or "reading list" (things they want to read later). Any story can also be shared out to social media. What this yields is a very easy to scan, content-rich interface to all the things going on.

There won't be any "interest matching" algorithms - those have proven to be biased, as well as creating echo chambers. Filter lists will be available so that stories with specific tags the user selects will either be shown more prominently ("stick" to the top of the feed for a while), or possibly send a notification if the priority is set high enough.

Some people will only have one main feed of "Top Stories". Some will want to track lots of things going on and have many feeds. Some will only customize alerts so they get notified if there's something they told the system they want to read about. And there'll be everything in between - and the preferences may change with time. For instance, the "Government" will likely get more interest in election years. But the interface will scale with the level and scope of the information each users registers interest in.

### Discussion

So, rather than “fact-checking” the existing Main Stream Media, the idea here is to simply replace their function with something faster, less costly, and more accurate. This new service would run 24x7, but since there’s no 24-hour “broadcast” there’s no need to fill 24 hours a day with content (which is kind of how this mess started - opinion was inserted to fill time and bump ratings, and that suddenly became viewed as "news").

As we have seen in the recent election, there is a small army of people already out there who are "fact junkies". Who will pore over reams of data to pull out what's important. Who will fact-check everything three times before posting anything. Who are driven to find the truth. This service will bring these people into the news-reporting system. Likewise, there are dozens of really great Live Stream reporters around the country - who will go to anywhere things are happening. Not for fame, but because they're likewise driven to show people watching what's going on. This service will allow these folks to do what they love as professionals, instead of trying to get the job done out-of-pocket.

The Left will obviously portray this as “state-run news”, but it’s not. It’s state-funded, and it’s bi-partisan. The staff would be from both parties, as well as independents.  Their mission statement would be to “report the news the right way.” There’s good people from both sides who are sick of the current situation. In effect it’s a news service start-up, funded by the government.

This system is entirely doable. I’ve built online systems with many of these capabilities and it’s not that tough. Heck, I could probably build a working prototype of the system in 4-6 weeks. The bigger issue will be scalability because much of the time there will be heavy burst-mode traffic. But the core software system is feasible and a lot less expensive than running a TV station.
