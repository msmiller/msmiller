# Project: Monolith

This whole “fake news” thing is as absurd as it is dangerous. What I am submitting here is an approach to turn this situation around.

The idea comes from the way I get my news. I don’t watch TV news. I follow a small number of Twitter feeds that have proven reliable in delivering facts. For instance, one is a feed that just tracks where gunfire or violence happens around the world. When an alert goes up I quickly find follow-ups from local sources. By the time the “News Media” has the story, a lot of times the news they end up reporting is already quite stale.

Most people in the US are connected to the Internet. Even if just on their smart-phones, almost everyone can get online. What I propose is an entirely new online media platform run in a new way. The highlights are as follows:

### Overview

- The service would be entirely devoted to delivering news and only news. Not opinions. Not politics. Not people sitting around on sofas making snide remarks. Actual news of what is happening. The focus would be on accuracy and speed of delivery - get the factual news out to people better and faster than the “real” media can do it.
* There would be no “anchor” desk. Video segments would be shot either on-location and streamed live, or would be shot at the various satellite offices. The state of technology today removes the need for expensive broadcast studios for doing the news.
* Not being burdened with needing to fill 24-hours of air time, or with preparing for a pre-set broadcast schedule reduces the overhead greatly.
* A central editors desk would decide on which stories get posted when. “Central” means organizationally central - with online conferencing this whole network of news offices can be sited anywhere across the country.

### Content

* There would be three kinds of content. Stories, Streams, and Analysis.
* A “Story” is just like in a newspaper. Something happened, here are the facts. It can have video, Twitter posts, written copy, images, audio - very mixed-media - whatever it takes to tell it.
* A “Stream” is something happening now. It would be a combination of staff reporting and gathering information from The Internet and reposting it in the feed of posts with video reports inter-spliced. The difference would be that this new agency could call local sources with the authority of a real news service and talk to local law enforcement and get the facts. These would then get posted. The response time would be faster than anything the “News Media” could muster. Once the event is over, the Stream becomes a Story.
* An “Analysis” is a long-standing issue or story which needs explanation. Where facts alone aren’t enough and you need expert opinions or more in-depth reporting. An example would be “unemployment.” Most people don’t know that there are multiple ways unemployment is measured and that it’s possible by choosing which figures to report for unemployment to “go down” while joblessness “went up”. Such content would engage experts on the issue from both sides to present their position. This would be like the rest: mixed media. If there was an online debate, there would be no screaming contests, just sane logical discourse. The goal is to provide facts from all perspectives and then let the people decide what it means to them.
* In order to mitigate bias, there would always be at least two staffers working on any piece of content. For a Stream, an ad-hoc team will be assembled for the time the Stream is running based on staff having experience or knowledge relevant to the incident being covered. Again, with teleconferencing and groupware, this allows knowledgeable assets to be brought to bear from all over the country or all over the planet.
* Subject matter would be: General News, Government (as opposed to “Politics” - would include: Policy, White House, Congress, Military, Committees, The Law, etc.), Business (& Economy), America (also broken into regions), World (also broken down into regions/continents), Health, Technology, and Science. No sports. No “entertainment” or fashion. Just the news that actually affects people’s day-to-day lives. Obviously news items could be associated with more than one category.

### Technology & Delivery

* The actual delivery mechanism would be online and mobile Apps. No need for broadcast towers or studios. Put the money into online content delivery and hiring good field reporters, writers, and online personalities. The App would allow users to tailor the alerts and filters based on interest, region, city, tags, and level of urgency (i.e. maybe you only want to be notified if something big happens).
* This would **not** be a social-media site, however. If folks want social media around it, they can spin up their own sites (hey … that creates more jobs!). This service would be only about news delivery. Making the American public the best informed it can be.
* There would be an API built into the system to allow new SaaS providers to hook in. For instance, if someone wanted to provide polls for Stories, there would be a way for them to do that without affecting or threatening the core system - the poll would appear on the page, but wouldn’t be allowed “inside” the news system.
* The one exception to the above rule is the service would also host Ask-Me-Anything segments from time to time with folks either from the Administration or from other walks of life whenever something was going on that warranted it. Again, these would be live and unedited - which means they’re also more honest and open.
* The cry that will no doubt erupt of “that’s state-run media” will be silenced by transparency. Any video segment that gets edited for time will have the original source material also posted. Any documents will likewise have the originals attached to the story record within the system. Nothing will be hidden. As we’ve seen from the last six months, facts are winning now and will continue to do so.

### Reporting

* Live-Streaming reporters would be a big part of this. Good live-streaming reporters get better coverage and more “human” coverage than anything the likes of CNN can touch. It would need field reporters free of bias - driven to get the real story of what’s happening, not to feed their own personal narrative. What we used to call: journalists. Viewers are savvy enough now to sniff out biased reporting, so hitting that sweet spot with the field reporters is crucial.
* Good reporting will require going to protests and getting interviews with both sides, as well as the locals caught in the middle. For instance, Ferguson looked totally different when viewed from the Live-Streaming reporters than when viewed on the big-time TV Networks. Humanizing both sides of these debates is necessary to repair the damage of the last election.
* The Administration will need to make itself available to this new network’s reporters for unstructured interviews as well. The utter lack of transparency these last eight years needs to be undone. Also I think people will be very impressed with folks like Mattis if they hear them speak and answer questions.
* The reporters - field and desk-bound - will need to be more specialized and less generalists than what you have in a newsroom. Each should have areas of specific expertise - legal, technology, military, sociology, etc. This helps not only give the news more authority, but an expert eye will spot Fake News before it gets published.

### Logistics

* This venture would be given bipartisan and permanent funding. That is: they can’t be shut down for reporting inconvenient truths.  This also makes it more trustworthy as it’s essentially being funded by the people and not one party or the other, or some corporate interest.
* The actual content delivery platform (the part that excites me as a technologist) wouldn’t be that expensive to build. It’d need a new kind of publishing workflow to accommodate the speed of action needed, but otherwise it’s pretty standard Content Management principles. Servers would be positioned regionally for better response and to distribute load across the population centers better.
* This would require a core technology team of maybe a dozen people to build the system.
- Groupware, telecommuting, and agile development would be brought to bear to allow the broadcast and field offices to be located cost-effectively and also be re-located as needed. For instance, something like the Dakota Access Pipeline would warrant spinning up a field office near the action using just laptops and hand-held cameras and a rented storefront. When the news moves on, the office would be torn town and everyone goes back home.
* The system would utilize various SaaS providers (US-based, of course) to provide some core functionality (and thereby reduce development time and cost). This would be an obvious boost for these providers, creating more tech jobs, and reinforcing the Trump administration’s commitment to the Technology Sector.

### Discussion

So, rather than “fact-checking” the existing Main Stream Media, the idea here is to simply replace their function with something faster, less costly, and more accurate. This new service would run 24x7, but since there’s no 24-hour “broadcast” there’s no need to fill 24 hours a day with content (which is kind of how this mess started - opinion was inserted to fill time and bump ratings, and that suddenly became viewed as “news).

The Left will obviously portray this as “state-run news”, but it’s not. It’s state-funded, and it’s bi-partisan. The staff would be from both parties, as well as independents.  Their mission statement would be to “report the news the right way.” There’s good people from both sides who are sick of the current situation. In effect it’s a news service start-up, funded by the government.

This system is entirely doable. I’ve built systems with some of these capabilities and it’s not that tough. The bigger issues will be scalability because much of the time there will be heavy burst-mode traffic. But the core software system is feasible and a lot less expensive than running s TV station.
