<img src="/assets/images/dtv.png" style="float:right">I've committed to myself to finish a book that I've been taking notes on for a few years. ["Different Things Vary"](https://differentthingsvary.com/) reflects the experiences and techniques I've gathered from four decades as a developer in the Tech Industry. It will cover everything from coding techniques to going out on your own as a freelancer or entrepreneur, as well as getting into management, and the lifestyle of an engineer.
